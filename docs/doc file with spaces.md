# doc file with spaces

This exists to demonstrate an issue I noticed just recently with the search function adding + signs into URLs with spaces which results in dead links when searching.

It looks like the search on this far more vanilla installation works just fine. Try changing the TravisCI build to upgrade mkdocs.
