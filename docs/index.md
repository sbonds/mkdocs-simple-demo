# mkdocs simple demo

This exists to demonstrate aspects of mkdocs, such as bugs, in a way where the whole process is easy to understand and reproduce.

## Demo: nested unordered lists

* This is an unordered list item
* This is another item
  * This should appear indented UNDER "This is another item"
* This is yet another item and should be at the original indent level
