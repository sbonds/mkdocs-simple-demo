# mkdocs-simple-demo

Simple CI/CD-enabled repository for demonstrating aspects of mkdocs

## License

The BSD license was chosen for maximum compatibility with the [`mkdocs`](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/) project.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is for demonstrating bugs or issues with `mkdocs` in a simple public environment.

## GitHub Actions

To resolve "Invalid deployment branch and no branch protection rules set in the environment. Deployments are only allowed from gh-pages" I needed to configure "Environments/github-pages" in GitHub to allow deployments from "master"

## Output

The rendered markdown pages are found at [Simple public demo for mkdocs](https://sbonds.github.io/mkdocs-simple-demo/)
